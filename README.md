This git repository holds Supplementary Table 1, 2, 4, and 5 from the 2019 Fontsere et al study  "An approach to increase molecular complexity from target captured fecal samples". These supplementary tables themselves hold some data points and summary statsitics for the individual libraries and hybridization pools used in the study. 

In addition it contains some Rmarkdown scripts and reports used to analyze the data for generating results for the publication itself.
